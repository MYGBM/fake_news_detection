# Fake news detection

## Data preprocessing

This is the data preprocessing step. We found the data from this [source](https://github.com/MenbereHailu/Amharic_Fake_News_Detection_On_Social_Media-_Using_Pretrained-_Language_Model/blob/main/Merged%20_Fakenews_Data.xlsx).
What we did in the preprocessing step is first normalize the data into a single standard. We removed white spaces and special characters. We also removed underscores(`_`) and hyphens(`-`). This was for the preprocessing step.
